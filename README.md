This week's challenge was to create a calendar application that allowed users to save events for each hour of the day. This app was powere by jQuery and also used Moment.js. 
The challenge gave us an initial code to start off with and it was involving bootstrap as well. I had to create columns.
I created a row of the time block, text block, and save block.

They also provided a mock up preview of what it needed to look like. Under the preview I will attach a screenshot of what mine look like.
