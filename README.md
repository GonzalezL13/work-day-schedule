This week's challenge was to create a calendar application that allowed users to save events for each hour of the day. This app was powere by jQuery and also used Moment.js. 
The challenge gave us an initial code to start off with and it was involving bootstrap as well. 
Below are the acceptance criteria the challenge provided.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


They also provided a mock up preview of what it needed to look like. Under the preview I will attach a screenshot of what mine look like.

The way the app works is you're able to schedule and event or task at any hour. Then you're able to save it into local storage. Depending on the time the color of the text block will change. The color means it's due or past due or you still have time.
